## Init

1. Install [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/#download) (the 2D game prototyping engine)
2. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/maurop123/pong.git`
3. From just outside the repo's folder, run `love pong`

## Controls

Press ENTER to start and reset the game. Player 1 can move the left paddle up with `w` and down with `s`. Player 2 can move the right paddle with `up arrow` and down with `down arrow`.

This game is cooperative. The goal is simply to keep the ball going back and forth for as long as possible. The team's score is tracked in number of volleys.

Enjoy!
